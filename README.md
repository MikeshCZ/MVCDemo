Model-View-Controller C++ simple template with command line promt.

[Model–view–controller (MVC)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Model%E2%80%93view%E2%80%93controller) is a software architectural pattern commonly used for developing user interfaces that divide the related program logic into three interconnected elements. This is done to separate internal representations of information from the ways information is presented to and accepted from the user.

Traditionally used for desktop graphical user interfaces (GUIs), this pattern became popular for designing web applications.[4] Popular programming languages have MVC frameworks that facilitate the implementation of the pattern.

### The MVC pattern provides a clean separation of objects into:
- Models for maintaining data.
- Views for displaying all or a portion of the data.
- Controllers for handling events that affect the model or view(s).
